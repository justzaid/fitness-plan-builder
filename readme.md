## Description

FitFusion is a fitness web application that invites guests and users to join a community of *fitness enthusiasts* to share their workout plans and routines together. Users can contribute and add the routines that they use, working towards a stronger, healthier body.

This project idea was chosen for the web application because it holds purpose, and it gives not only users but also guests the ability to explore the different features provided by the application. Users have the ability to create their personal accounts and contribute to a society they resonate with, including extra privileges such as viewing, updating, or deleting workout plans.

This application also has the potential to expand and introduce complex features to add user engagement within the community.

## Technologies Used

**Node** was the runtime environment used to build the web application by allowing JavaScript code to run outside of typical browser clients. Another benefit from using this technology was the addition of real-time updates when changes are made during implementation instead of manually running the code.

**Node Package Manager** is a package manager that provided several benefits in the creation of the project. The package manager played a crucial role in providing open-source packages and libraries such as EJS templating, Express, Mongoose, Method-override, etc.

**Express** was the framework used to build the web application with Node.js. It simplified the process of building the application by facilitating a set of features such as route handling called RESTful routing, middleware to block or allow tasks based on certain conditions such as user authentication, handling HTTP methods, etc.

**EJS Templating** is a templating language used to generate HTML pages with embedded JavaScript. There were many benefits of using EJS to render pages. Some of these benefits included running JavaScript code directly in the HTML template to perform functions, creating dynamic pages with dynamic content based on assigned variables in controller files, utilizing reusable templates through partials for *DRY* coding, etc.

**MongoDB** is an open-source *NoSQL* database that was used to store this web application's data. Since *MongoDB* is a document-oriented database, dealing with a variety of user inputs and creating unique plans in a non-sequential order made it the perfect choice of data storage.

## Next steps

Besides creating an application that contains all CRUD processes, the web application has the potential to grow and bring forth many features utilizing the technologies used. Future goals may involve boosting engagement among registered users within the community.

This engagement can be, 

+ Personalizing user profiles
+ Favoriting workout plans
+ User plan reputation, and much more.

> Another interesting feature could also include creating a tracker that logs workouts completed and provide badges for a number of completions.
